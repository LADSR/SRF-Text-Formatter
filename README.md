This is an automatic text formatter. It takes a word document and changes it to a format wiki text format.
You must have a python interpretaer and python docx to use this application.

Everything is run from cmd line but later I'll make a html script to make it more user friendly.
Right Now everything is used from run.py located in the root directory.
