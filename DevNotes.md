This is where I leave notes for Myself

Levi's Notes for Levi:
    if p.text has no text remove line at beginning
    Spaces/Indents make text subtext
    Maybe h2 shouldn't appear as heading 3 unless alone/ only one in a row
    change heading three depending on length too. h3 should also be indented if under h2
    Option for yes table of contents or no table of contents in gui
    Account for indents and delete them

    h3 doesn't have bullete sometimes and it looks ugly
    more than one heding 1 should be formatted diffrently (As one para not seprate)

GUI:
    if they select formatting to first give them a popup telling them to select format from first
